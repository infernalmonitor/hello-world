# hello-world
My nickname is InfernalMonitor.
Please, don't google it - there is a 99% chance that you'll hate me.
Well, that's not a big problem...
I am here to learn how to code and make/organise projects.
Why? Because I:
1) need it for my work as a lawyer
2) thinking in a program-friendly way
3) way too tired to use someone else's code at work.
Seriously, the code in point "3" is so awfulm that no one can use the program (programs) without a long-time training :-)
ALso, if you need any help with copyright - feel free to ask me. 
I know almost everything about it all over the world. 
If not - well, it's easy to learn.
